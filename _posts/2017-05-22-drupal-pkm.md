Drupal is an open source CMS with great standard features, great flexibility, amazing performance and modularity for improving the core experience.

Drupal PKM is a project that started along with [MD Systems](https://www.md-systems.ch), a Switzerland based company that works with Drupal 8 and it is one of the top contributors for Drupal. We had long conversations for defining the goal of this project and we defined it as being a Personal Knowledge Management platform based on Drupal 8.

### What do we want?

With this project we want to build a complete knowledge management platform which will allow users to have control over all the knowledge they have, it will basically allow the users add third-party resources where they can add notes and classify content for, later, getting a knowledge graph.
The knowledge graph will represent all the concepts that the user know and the platform will also let the users add tags and having historic views of all the info they gathered.

### Why is this needed?

There has been a lot of research made around knowledge management, the base concept is "Social learning theory" that makes reference about introducing platforms for sharing knowledge in companies.
Creating a platform that is "bottom-up" built at University level, will allow students to track their knowledge. Thus, they will be able to share their knowledge as individuals.
