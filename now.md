I am living in El Alto City, Bolivia, working on my thesis about Knowledge Management with MD Systems as supporter.

I am working on some music projects along with some other software development ideas.

I am reading the book "The future of space time" by Stephen Hawking, really recommended book since it explains a lot about Quantum mechanics and the relativity theory.
